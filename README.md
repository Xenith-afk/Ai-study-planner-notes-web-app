StudyFlow is an AI-driven study management application designed to help students organise their learning more efficiently. It combines automated note generation, personalised study planning, and an intelligent chat assistant that understands and responds based on the user’s saved materials. The goal of StudyFlow is to make learning simpler, faster, and more structured by integrating modern AI capabilities into a clean and easy-to-use interface.

The platform allows users to generate detailed study notes from any topic or uploaded PDF. Using an AI generation pipeline, StudyFlow structures information into summaries, explanations, key concepts, and examples, making it easier for students to revise complex subjects. All notes are automatically saved and can be accessed from the dashboard at any time.

StudyFlow also includes a dedicated AI Study Buddy that provides context-aware academic assistance. The chat system is trained on the user’s stored notes, enabling it to answer questions in real time with relevant and accurate information. This feature enables students to clarify doubts quickly without switching between external resources.

In addition to note generation and AI chat assistance, StudyFlow offers a study planning module. Users can create comprehensive study schedules, add tasks, set targets, and track their progress. The planner is designed to help students stay consistent with their learning goals while maintaining a clear overview of their workload.

The application is built using modern web technologies, including React/Next.js for the frontend, TailwindCSS for styling, and serverless API routes for backend AI operations. It integrates with AI models through environment-secured API endpoints, ensuring reliable and safe processing of user data.

StudyFlow aims to become an all-in-one academic assistant by combining note creation, planning, and real-time AI support. Future improvements may include flashcard generation, spaced repetition, quizzes based on user notes, and advanced analytics.
